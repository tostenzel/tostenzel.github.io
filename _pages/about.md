Hi, my name is Tobias! I'm writing my Master's Thesis about transformers and video data in Mannheim.

I admire accessible and unpretentious explanations of complex things.

Apparently, I could give something back. I set up this site share with you some of my professional findings and experiences on my <a href='http://tostenzel.github.io/blog/'>blog</a>. About deep learning for the start. 👻
