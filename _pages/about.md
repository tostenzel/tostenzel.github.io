Hi, my name is Tobias! I'm writing my Master's Thesis in Computer Vision about transformers and video data at Mannheim University.

I admire accessible explanations of complex things at the right level of abstraction.

Perhaps I can give something back. I set up this site to share with you some of my learnings on my <a href='http://tostenzel.github.io/blog/'>blog</a>. About deep learning for the start. ðŸ‘»
